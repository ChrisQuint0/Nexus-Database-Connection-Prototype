<h1>Nexus Database Connection Prototype</h1>
<p>The main goal of this prototype is for the developer to figure out how websites communicate with their databases online. The prototype source code connects to the local database in a local machine but the actual hosted site is deployed in InfinityFree and connects to the online MySQL database</p>
